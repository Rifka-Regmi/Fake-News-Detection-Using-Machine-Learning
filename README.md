The objective of this project is to build a machine learning system that detects fake news and provides users with an interactive tool for accurate classification.

- Loaded datasets of true and fake news articles, assigning binary labels for classification.
- Removed unnecessary columns and cleaned text data by eliminating punctuation, URLs, and numerical characters.
- Transformed textual data into numerical features using TF-IDF vectorization.
- Trained Logistic Regression and Random Forest classifiers to detect fake news.
- Evaluated model performance using accuracy scores and classification reports.
- Developed an interactive interface for users to input news text and receive predictions.
